# Crime Rate Prediction Project
This project aims to analyze and predict crime rates by using the following algorithms
- Kmeans: for clustering
- Decision Tree: for classification and predicting numerical values
We are going through the following process to achieve that:
- Data Preprocessing
- Understanding Data
- Model Evaluation
- Data Visualization

finally, we added ability to predict type of crime by entering some data like location,time
